class_name ArmourPointsStat extends RPGSegmentedStat

## The ArmourPointStat consists of a number of Armour Segments. Unlike the
## Health Stat this stat will be associated with a piece of Armour you wear so

## stat is for the actual amount of armour you have not the percentage of damage 
## it absorbs
